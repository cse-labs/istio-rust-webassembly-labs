# Istio Rust WebAssembly Hands-on Labs

> Hands-on Labs for building, deploying and testing an Envoy WebAssembly built in Rust running in an Istio sidecar in Kubernetes

## Welcome

The lab content will be updated before the event

> If you can access this page, you're all set!
>
> See you on Thursday at 9am Redmond time

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the inner-loop developer setup on Codespaces
- Understand the Envoy WebAssembly model
- Understand how to implement a plug-in using Rust
- Understand the Istio WebAssembly deployment model
- Deploy and test in Kubernetes using an Istio sidecar

This hands-on lab is open to members of the WW Azure Technical Community. To join, please visit: https://aka.ms/joinwwazcom.

Note that the Istio WebAssembly model is still very immature so expect a few bumps in the road as we learn together. We do love breaking things!
